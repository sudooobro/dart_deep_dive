Error handling and exception make your code robust and improve user experience.

Different kind of error:
Some Example:
1) Read or write files error called -> I/O Error
2) Network request -> Networking Errors
3) When user makes error on the code -> Programmer Error

Types to handle the errors:
1) Assertion
2) throw exceptions
3) try, catch, finally, rethrow

Difference between error and exceptions
Error:
1) Programmer mistake
2) Calling a function with invalid arguments index out of bounds etc.
3) Programmer should terminate immediately (not safe to recover)

Exception:
1) Failure condition: Something unexpected happen
2) Unexpected out of control
3) Handle it (eg: show message to user and recover)
